# Contest guidelines

Here are a few tips for the teaching assistants regarding the contest.

## Setup

Activate your VPN, and connect to your server. Make sure the config is up to date, especially:

- the group keys;
- the rounds config;
- and that the server starts paused and makes a pause between each round.

Moreover, change the random `seed` in the config file to some random integer!

## Rounds

The default sound level (on your computer) should be 60%.

1. Functionnality: nothing to do;
2. Sound levels: 60%, 50%, 40%, and 30%, for laps 1, 5, 9, and 13;
3. Range: put 10 dB attenuators, and increase the range for laps 1, 5, 9, and 13;
4. Light: decrease the light level for laps 1, 5, 9, and 13;
5. Classification accuracy: this should be handled by the script.
