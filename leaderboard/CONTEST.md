# Contest guidelines

Here are a few tips for the teaching assistants regarding the contest.

## Setup

Activate your VPN, and connect to your server. Make sure the config is up to date, especially:

- the group keys;
- the rounds config;
- and that the server starts paused and makes a pause between each round.

Moreover, change the random `seed` in the config file to some random integer!

## Rounds

The default sound level (on your computer) should be set so that the background
noise is barely hearable. The audio volume of sound events will be adjusted automatically,
relative to the level of the background noise.
