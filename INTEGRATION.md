# Integration

This document summarizes the different steps needed to integrate all the
separate parts of this project into one working pipeline.

## Requirements

We assume that you have completed all previous assigments,
and that missing code fragments have been successfully filled.

Make sure that your repository is up-to-date with our main branch, and
that you installed the latest Python dependencies with:

<!-- tell users to run commands from within the root directory or subdirectories -->

```
rye sync
```

Also, make sure to run the above command from the repository directory, or from
any of its subdirectories. The same applies for all `rye` commands.

## Steps

![How to run the full project](./integration.png)

A working telecommunication chain can be set up by following the steps
summarized in the figure above, and explained hereafter[^1]:

1. _(Any)_ synthesize your RTL design with Quartus and program your LimeSDR-Mini LimeSuite;
2. _(Any)_ program your Nucleo board with STM32CubeIDE, using the MAIN_APP config.;
3. _(Linux)_ open the project files with GNU Radio,
   and generate the Python script(s);
4. _(Linux)_ run your GNU Radio script either from GNU Radio or from the terminal;
5. _(Any)_ in another terminal window, run `rye run auth | rye run classify`;
6. and that's all!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Running `rye run classify` does not actually submit your classification
> guesses to the leaderboard server. To do so, you will need to add a few
> lines of codes, see the corresponding [README](leaderboard/README.md).

    Any refers to any OS (best to use your host OS here).

## Customizing

Most parameters in scripts have default values that can be changed in the Python
files, via command-line options, or via environ variables.

For parameters that are use in multiple places, like `melvec_length`,
it is very important to use the same values all across your different
project parts. For those, it is better to use an environ variable,
e.g., `MELVEC_LENGTH=20`.

To setup environ variables, the easiest is to populate the [`.env`](.env) file with
the environ variables. This file is automatically loaded when calling
`rye run auth` or `rye run classify`.

## How the complete chain works

The chain is made of multiple consecutive blocks, that need to communicate with each other.

1. The Nucleo board listens to sound events, processes the raw audio data and sends packets
   through the air using the TX antenna;
2. The LimeSDR receives the packets via its RX antenna, performs some processing on the packets, and
   send them through the USB-driver to GNU Radio for further processing;
3. GNU Radio receives packets from the USB, and publishes the decoded packets to some TCP address, using
   the ZMQ message passing protocol;
4. `rye run auth` reads packets published at the provided TCP address, performs authentification on them,
   and extracts the payload, containing the useful information, and print each payload on a new line;
5. `rye run classify` reads the consecutive payloads from an input and performs a classification on each of them (e.g.,
   by predicting a `fire` event). Using `rye run auth | rye run classify` allows to run both commands simultaneously,
   while redirecting the output of authentification to the input of classification.decodes the packets and

During the contest, guesses must be sent to the leaderboard. Hence, one should modify the
[`classify` script](./classification/src/classification/__main__.py) to send guesses to the leaderboard using
HTTP requests.
