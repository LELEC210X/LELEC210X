### Usage

Launching the UART Reader utility requires this command :

```bash
rye run uart-reader <optional flags>
```

To create a classification model that can be used by the UART Reader utilty requires the modification of the `src/contrib/uart_reader/model_trainer.py` file, and you must run this command for it to be correctly interpreted by the utility :

```bash
rye run model-trainer
```

> [!NOTE]
> The utility is for the moment, only a GUI based application, and does not have the sufficient capabilities to run only in the console. If you do need such an application, please refer to [Section 1.2 of the Manual](./UART_READER.md#section-12---launching-the-old-utility) on how to use the old version of the uart-reader application. With reduced functionality.

### Optional Flags

For more information, please refer to [Section 1.1 of the Manual](./UART_READER.md#section-11---launching-the-gui)

### Making your own classifier

For more information, please refer to [Section 1.3 of the Manual](./UART_READER.md#section-13---training-and-using-your-own-classifier)

### Accessing the old stable version

If you want for some reason to use the old version of the uart-reader, then please refer to [Section 1.2 of the Manual](./UART_READER.md#section-12---launching-the-old-utility). Where all steps are given with detail.
