        "Let us show again the block-diagram of the project. The very first hands-on session was focused on computing the feature vector from a sound vector. \n",

        "There exists a lot of different classification models in the literature. In this notebook we propose to play with two simple and intuitive classifiers: the K-Nearest-Neighbour (``KNN``) classifier and the Linear Discriminant Analysis (``LDA``) classifier. The related Wikipedia page are [KNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) and [LDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis). <br>\n",
        "Made simple, KNN and LDA are ``supervised machine learning algorithms``. For KNN, each new point to be classified is compared with its K nearest neighbours among labelled data (i.e. points whose class is known) in the dataspace with respect to a chosen distance metric. For LDA, the data distributions of the classes are assumed to be normal, i.i.d. and with the same covariance. The decision boundaries are set to areas in the distribution space where the log-likelihood that the data belongs to another class is higher than the true class. It is worth noticing that the LDA classifier is a parametric model while KNN is not. Indeed, KNN has only one hyperparameter $K$, but the learning phase simply consist of saving the learning set in memory to be used later for inference.  <br>\n",
        "\n",
        "To avoid reinventing the wheel, we will use the implementations provided by ``sklearn``. You are strongly encouraged to have a look at the documentation [for the KNN](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neighbors.KNeighborsClassifier.html) and [for the LDA](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/lda_qda.html?highlight=lda). We will also use ``pickle`` for saving and loading the trained models. <br>\n",

For example, this is the trick used in [SVM](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html) when radial basis functions or polynomial kernels are used (not shown here). Run the code here below and observe how well we are able to transform three intricate rings of data points into three localised point clouds using a technique called *spectral clustering*. "

A motivation is that usual norms behave counter-inuitively in high dimension. To reduce the dimensionality, we will use the ``Principal compenent analysis (PCA)`` proposed by sklearn. See the [associated Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis). We start by illustrating the interest of PCA with a toy example."
