\section{Accelerating the preamble detector}
As introduced in the previous Hands-On, our demodulation chain requires a component called the \textit{preamble detector} that actively seeks the preamble sequence located at the beginning of a packet. When the preamble is found, this block forwards the input samples downstream for further processing. This system allows to avoid unnecessary heavy computations as well as real-time operation. As the preamble detector operates continuously, it is best to move its functionality from software towards specialized hardware in order to improve its \textbf{energy efficiency and processing speed}. If we decide at one point to increase the packet rate of the overall transmission chain, this solution is more robust regarding packet misses. It is also further motivated by the fact that this block occurs at the very beginning of the processing chain, just after the low-pass filter we designed in the previous section.

\subsection{Design overview}
We implemented for you a preamble detector module in SystemVerilog HDL\footnote{Although uncommon, it is possible to mix multiple HDL languages in a single design. For instance, the majority of the LimeSDR-Mini system is written in VHDL, but for your convenience we have written the preamble detector in SystemVerilog.}. First, open the Quartus project, \texttt{LimeSDR-Mini\_lms7\_lelec210x/LimeSDR-Mini\_lms7\_lelec210x.qpf}. If a message asking you for overwriting the database is printed, click "yes". You can then open the preamble detector design file located in \texttt{LimeSDR-Mini\_lms7\_lelec210x/ip/preamble\_detect/preamble\_detect.sv} and containing the following interfaces:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A clock and reset interface.
    \item A sink (input) streaming interface with data and valid signals.
    \item A source (output) streaming interface with data and valid signals.
    \item A custom static interface for configuration signals.
\end{itemize}
The preamble detector follows the low-pass filter in the receiver chain, as you have seen in previous hands-on. The filter, implemented using a FIR, is already included in the hardware design provided to you. Indeed, as a FIR is composed of multiply-and-accumulate operations, it can be easily accelerated in hardware. The preamble detector module is integrated as a custom IP inside the same subsystem as the FIR, it therefore shares the same streaming interfaces\footnote{See pp 40-52 of \texttt{mnl\_avalon\_spec.pdf} on Moodle for details.}: the data bus is 24-bit wide with the MSBs and LSBs containing the samples of the I and Q channels respectively. In addition a valid signal is associated with the streaming data to indicate whether the data bus contains information of interest, or not. With the preamble detector, the goal is to produce an output valid signal that indicates if the complex magnitude of the data has reached a threshold.

\subsection{Preamble Detector schematic}
In Figure \ref{fig:pd_schematic} below you can find a schematic of the different modules that compose the preamble detector. It functions as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Complex to magnitude: } The IQ samples are processed by a \textit{complex to magnitude} block which outputs the magnitude of the complex IQ vector.
    To do so, we calculate the square of the magnitude as $I^2+Q^2$. As square-root function are difficult to implement in hardware logic, the result is initially kept squared in the rest of the pipeline. This does not pose any problem as long as the bus width and the threshold is adapted.

    \item \textbf{Running sum: } The estimated complex magnitude is then averaged over multiple samples by a configurable \textit{moving average filter}. It is implemented by forwarding input samples in a \textit{delay line} of configurable length.

    \begin{align}
            y[n] = \sum_{k=0}^{N-1}\left|x[n-k]\right|
    \end{align}

    At each clock cycle an accumulator adds and substracts the first and last magnitudes stored in the delay line to its content. This structure is more efficient than the general FIR because we know each tap is equal to one, we therefore only need two adders.

    \begin{align}
            y[n+1] = y[n] + \left|x[n]\right| - \left|x[n-N+1]\right|
    \end{align}

    To implement a configurable length delay line, we use \textit{SystemVerilog arrays}. Because SystemVerilog forbids to use arrays as module ports, we are forced to pack the array into a bus and unpack the bus back into an array to index it. These concepts should be familiar to you when using \texttt{numpy.flatten} or \texttt{numpy.reshape}.

    \item \textbf{Counter :} The averaged value is compared with a configurable threshold and can trigger the start of a counter. This start/stop counter is used to count the samples to let through when the threshold has been reached by the moving average. A \texttt{launch} signal starts the counter, it stops only after reaching its maximum value. During the sequence a \texttt{running} signal indicates the state of the counter.

    \item \textbf{Debugging multiplexer: }At last a multiplexer is needed if we want to disable entirely the preamble detector, for debugging purposes.

\end{enumerate}

    \caption{Hardware Preamble Detector Schematic}
    \label{fig:pd_schematic}
\end{figure}

In order to reduce the length of the critical path between registers, we use a paradigm called \textit{pipelining}. In short, we divide the operations of the preamble detector into several stages with similar length. As the critical path in this configuration is much shorter, it allows to operate the circuit at a higher frequency. In return, the additional registers add area and energy consumption to the design. It also requires to forward control signals in the pipeline and it can add complexity (see \textit{Control Path} in Figure \ref{fig:pd_schematic}). You will learn the concept of pipelining in details when studying the \textit{pipelined processor} in the course of \texttt{LELEC2531}.

Try to understand the SystemVerilog implementation of those blocks with respect to their theoretical behavior. Pay particular attention to the bus width of intermediate signals, they are computed in order to systematically avoid any overflow of intermediate values!


\subsection{Timing analysis of the initial preamble detector}

As you have seen in course, an important aspect of digital design is to ensure that your design meet both the resource and timing requirements. Indeed, long combinatorial logic path can lead to setup or hold constraints violations. The design we provided to you has already been compiled and the timing analysis has already been performed. You can check the compilation report using the shortcut highlighted in Figure \ref{fig:compilation_report_button}. If it is not available, you must perform a full compilation of the design. Be careful when launching a compilation in Quartus, a window may ask you to update the project revision. Answer NO.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/Compilation_report_button.PNG}
    \caption{Toolbar of Quartus. The Compilation Report shortcut is highlighted in red.}
    \label{fig:compilation_report_button}
\end{figure}

\begin{bclogo}[couleur = gray!20, arrondi = 0.2, logo=\bcattention]{MAX 10 Device Support might not be installed}
    The support for the FPGA device we use might not be installed in the Quartus you have, which will lead to errors in the compilation. The installation instructions are provided to you in the "Hands-on FPGA: Installation of the required components" document.

\end{bclogo}

In the \textit{"Flow Summary"} tab, the resource utilisation is reported. Observe that no embedded multiplier are employed while we perform two multiplications in the \textit{cmplx2mag} block. Moreover, in the \textit{"Analysis \& Synthesis/Timing Analyzer"} tab, you can see the results for the different corners, constraints violations being highlighted in red. Try to identify the faulty clock involved. In the different summary proposed, you can right click on a clock and select \textit{"Report Timing... (In Timing Analyzer UI)"}. In the opened window, just press \textit{"Report Timing"} at the bottom. Those steps are depicted in Figure \ref{fig:report_timing_analyzer}. You can now analyze the most critical path implying the selected clock, as well as the logic cells involved. Try to link the critical path to the RTL design. As we will perform multiple synthesis during the hands-on, please note each time the resource usage in terms of logic, as well as the worst setup slack.

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/Report_Timing_Analyzer.png}
    \caption{Steps to analyze the most critical path on a given clock.}
    \label{fig:report_timing_analyzer}
\end{figure}

Two mechanisms were used in the provided design that affected negatively the timing. First, to save resources and have a most pure logic-based design, embedded multipliers were disabled for the \textit{cmplx2mag} module. This was made possible by the \texttt{ (* multstyle = \textcolor{purple}{"logic"} *)} prefix at the beginning of the module definition, on line 26. Delete it and save the design. Remember we only modified the IP, we now need to propagate those changes to the actual design. To do so, we will need to use the Platform Designer, as the \textit{lms\_dsp} (Limesuite Digital Signal Processing) block has been implemented using this tool. It allows the interconnection of multiple blocks of a digital design with a more intuitive user interface. Open the Platform Design using the shortcut highlighted in Figure \ref{fig:quartus_platform_designer}. Open the \texttt{lms\_dps.qsys} design. Nothing has to be done except clicking \textit{"Generate HDL ..."} on the bottom right of the window and update the path to
\texttt{LimeSDR-Mini\_lms7\_lelec210x/lms\_dsp/} if it is not made automatically. Then press on \textit{"Generate}. The changes you made locally to the preamble detector have now been propagated. In the Platform Designer, you can quickly observe the structure of the \textit{lms\_dsp} block, with the FIR, the preamble detector and the different Avalon Streaming Interface. You can now compile your design and observe the resource and timing report.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figures/quartus_toolbar.PNG}
    \caption{Toolbar of Quartus. The Platform Designer shortcut is highlighted in yellow.}
    \label{fig:quartus_platform_designer}
\end{figure}

Second, we prevented \textbf{register retiming} which allows the synthesis tool to balance the combinatorial logic across registers when it does not affect the system behaviour. This helps on meeting the timing requirements by offloading parts of long combinatorial path. To enable this setting, go in \textit{"Assignments/Settings/Compiler Settings"} on Quartus and uncheck the \textit{"Prevent register retiming"} box.

Now relaunch a compilation and analyze the results. Again, if a window asks you to update the project revision, answer NO.  Has the resource usage changed? Is there still a timing constraint violation? Can you still link the most critical path to the HDL design?


\subsection{From Euclidean norm to Absolute-value norm}

In order to meet the timing requirements, another solution is to use a less complex estimation of the IQ samples magnitude. We are thus going to use a very simple and accurate algorithm that does not have the burden of implementing the complex logic of \textit{integer multiplication}. The estimate for the first quadrant of the trigonometric circle is drawn on Figure \ref{fig:cmplx2mag}. We ask you to implement it in System Verilog, the mathematical formula being provided to you in Equation \ref{eq:1norm}\footnote{Further information can be found online: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_max_plus_beta_min_algorithm} and \url{http://dspguru.com/dsp/tricks/magnitude-estimator/}.}. Your modification of the \texttt{cmplx2mag} module must be done in the \texttt{USER CODE} parts, which goes from line 45 to 52 and on line 210. As we were performing two multiplications and one addition in the previous algorithm ($I^2+Q^2$), the data bus at the output of the \textit{cmplx2mag} module was specified as twice the input data bit width (due to multiplication) plus one (due to the addition). This is specified on line 210, do not forget to adapt it for the new algorithm. In the next step, you are going to make a behavioral simulation of you implementation to validate it.

\begin{equation}
    |z| = \frac{min(|I|,|Q|)}{4} + max(|I|,|Q|)
    \label{eq:1norm}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[!h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{figures/trigo.png}
    \includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{figures/angle.png}
    \caption{Complex Magnitude Estimator output in x-y coordinates (left) or polar coordinates (right) for input points of the trigonometric circle.}
    \label{fig:cmplx2mag}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Simulation and synthesis}
\begin{sloppypar}
With your implementation of the Absolute-value norm estimator finished, we are going to use a testbench and a few python scripts and ModelSim to verify the preamble detector before deploying it into the complete system. A few python scripts located at \texttt{LimeSDR-Mini\_lms7\_lelec210x/ip/preamble\_detect/testbench/python} allow you to generate input vectors for the preamble detector and compare the testbench output with an expected result obtained with python:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{1\_input\_gen.py} : generates input vectors and export them for processing in python and as input vector of the preamble detector HDL implementation.
    \item \texttt{2\_output\_gen.py} : processes the python input vector with a software implementation of the preamble detector and exports the result.
    \item \texttt{3\_compare} : when the SystemVerilog testbench has been executed, compares the software and hardware preamble detector results, plotting them as well as their difference.
\end{enumerate}

The SystemVerilog testbench has already been generated for you. To execute it, open ModelSim and change the working directory to \texttt{LimeSDR-Mini\_lms7\_lelec210x/ip/preamble\_detect/testbench/mentor}. After having Then run \texttt{do run\_sim.tcl} in order to compile and launch the simulation.



\end{sloppypar}
\begin{bclogo}[couleur = gray!20, arrondi = 0.2, logo=\bcattention]{You cannot regenerate the testbench for the preamble detector}
    Unlike the testbench for the FIR filter that required to regenerate the internal files when updating the taps, this testbench do not need to be adjusted. In order to change the SystemVerilog parameters of the preamble detector, you need to directly adjust them in the file \texttt{LimeSDR-Mini\_}\\\texttt{lms7\_lelec210x/ip/preamble\_detect/testbench/mentor/preamble\_detect\_tb\_gen\_tb/}\\\texttt{simulation/submodules/preamble\_detect\_tb\_gen.v}.
\end{bclogo}

Now that you have a functional design for the preamble detector with the Absolute-value norm, we can perform a synthesis of the complete design. Do not forget to propagate your change by regenerating the HDL via the Platform Designer. Observe the resource usage and the timing report, is there still a timing constraint violation?
