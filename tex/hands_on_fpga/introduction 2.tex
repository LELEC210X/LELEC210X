\section*{Introduction}

During last week session, you learned how to use the LimeSDR Mini board and GNU Radio to receive and demodulate in software packets transmitted by the MCU. Yet, at very high data rates, the software processing of an entire digital signal processing chain becomes inefficient as it requires increasing amounts of computing resources. In this hands-on, you will learn how the parts of the GNU Radio receiver (low-pass filtering and preamble detection) can be offloaded to a hardware accelerator. We will here focus on the preamble detector, as the low-pass filter is already implemented using an IP. The hardware acceleration further allows the software-defined radio to process data streams at higher data rates that are otherwise not attainable. Multiple tools used here needs to be first installed. Please refer "Hands-on \handsOnN: Installation of the required components" document available on Moodle. The FPGA design with the low-pass filter and the preamble detector is provided by the teaching team inside a zip file.
