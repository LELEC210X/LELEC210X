\section*{Introduction}

During last week session, you learned how to use the LimeSDR Mini board and GNU Radio to receive and demodulate in software packets transmitted by the MCU. Yet, at very high data rates, the software processing of an entire digital signal processing chain becomes inefficient as it requires increasing amounts of computing resources. In this hands-on, you will learn how the parts of the GNU Radio receiver (low-pass filtering and preamble detection) can be offloaded to a hardware accelerator. We will here focus on the detection of the preamble, as the low-pass filter is already implemented using an IP. The hardware acceleration further allows the software-defined radio to process data streams at higher data rates that are otherwise not reachable. Multiple tools used here need to be installed first. Please refer to the wiki of the Git. The FPGA design with the low-pass filter and the packet presence detection is available on the Git. Do not forget to synchronize it before starting the hands-on.
