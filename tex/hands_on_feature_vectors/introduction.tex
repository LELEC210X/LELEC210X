The operations applied on the data are essentially the same as what you did during the first hands-on H1.
However there are two essential differences in this hands-on you will rapidly observe:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{The programming language}: you abandon the very easy and comfortable but high-level and slow \emph{Python} for low-level and fast \emph{C-code}.
    \item \textbf{Data representation}: for speed and memory issues due to the limitations of your MCU, you jump from the 32-bit \emph{floating point} representation to the 16-bit \emph{fixed point} representation.
\end{itemize}
%
This language switching implies new packages to handle for the use of fast implementation routines.

To start this hands-on session:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Open the \textbf{mcu/hands\_on\_feature\_vectors} project from File System on your \textbf{STM32CubeIDE}. 
    \item On STM32CubeIDE, open \textbf{hands\_on\_feature\_vectors.ioc} and click on \emph{Project$\rightarrow$Generate code}.
    \item In \emph{Code/}, open \textbf{config.h} and \textbf{spectrogram\_tables.h} from \emph{Inc/}, and \textbf{main.c}, \textbf{spectrogram.c} from \emph{Src/}.
\end{itemize}

% In this note, there are a few boxes presenting additional information:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \bcinfo will provide you some more detailed explanations.
%     \item \bcattention will explain typical mistakes that might lead to errors or a non functional system.
%     \item \bcquestion will provide you with additional questions or experiments that will improve your understanding of the system. We advise you to leave them for the end of the hands-on as they are not critical.
