\section*{Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Discover the CMSIS-DSP sofware library;
    \item Understand the \emph{fixed-point} representation;
    \item Start from a naive working implementation, analyze the computational complexity of each block and identify the bottlenecks.
    \item Make the first classifications on feature vectors acquired by the MCU.
\end{itemize}
