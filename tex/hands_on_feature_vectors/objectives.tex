\section*{Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Discover the CMSIS-DSP sofware library;
    \item Understand the \emph{fixed-point} representation;
    \item Start from a naive working implementation, analyze the computational complexity of each block and identify the bottlenecks.
    \item Make the first classifications on feature vectors acquired by the MCU.
    \item Calibrate the system by creating a dataset of acquired feature vectors.
    \item Run the whole chain!
\end{itemize}
