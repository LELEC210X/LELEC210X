\section{MCU - Embedded software}
For this part of the characterization, here is a list with key questions to be addressed :
\begin{itemize}
    \item For each of the main functions performed by the MCU, quantify their
        execution time, match them to a part of the current consumption profile
        of the MCU and compute the related energy consumption.
    \item Is the available \textbf{memory} (both volatile and non volatile) a
        limitation (both currently and in the foreseeable future) in the context of
        this project? (\textbf{Hint}: the \textit{Build Analyzer} of your IDE will help you for this.)
    \item Evaluate what would be the impact on the system functionality and
        performance if the following computations would be slower.
        For example, imagine that these computations require twice (or ten times)
        as many cycles as currently.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Feature vector calculation
            \item Packetizing (including authentication)
            \item Radio transmission
        \end{itemize}
        Based on your evaluation, classify those tasks between \emph{hard
        real-time}, \emph{soft real-time}, and \emph{non real-time}.
    \item Mention and justify your choice of compiler optimization level.
\end{itemize}
