    \begin{itemize}
        \item What are the number of cycles taken by the MAC function
            per authenticated byte for different message lengths ? Example parameters : 1 byte up to 200 bytes with steps of 1 byte for the different compiler optimization levels:
            \texttt{-O0},
            \texttt{-O1},
            \texttt{-O2},
            \texttt{-O3},
            \texttt{-Os}.\footnote{%
                To understand what these optimization levels do (as well as
                \texttt{-Og}), see
                \url{https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html}.
                The optimizations controlled by these flags happen at the compiler
                level, and each file is compiled individually.

                Since optimization is based on gathering information on the
                code and how it is used, this limited (file-level) view may lead to
                missed optimization opportunities.
                Link-time optimization (LTO) is a technique that enables
                project-level view for optimizations (see
                \url{https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html})
                and that you might want to use at some stage of your project.
                To add such custom compiler and linker flags, use the
                \textbf{Miscellaneous} section of the Compiler/Linker settings.
            }
        \item What is the code size of the MAC function when compiled with the different optimization levels ?
    \end{itemize}
