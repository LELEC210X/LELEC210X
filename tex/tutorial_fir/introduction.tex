\section*{Introduction}

During the Hands-on 4, you learned how the LimeSDR FPGA allows to reduce the computing performed in software, by accelerating in hardware the finite-impulse response filter (FIR) and the preamble detector. We focused especially on the preamble detector and the timing violations that can occur in FPGA implementations, as well as how to handle them. In this tutorial, we will focus on the FIR and show you how to adapt its frequency response depending on your specifications. \\
