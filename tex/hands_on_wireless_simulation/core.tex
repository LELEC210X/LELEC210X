\section{Overview of communication chain}
In this section, the different steps involved in the communication chain are presented.

\subsection{Transmitted signal}
The idea behind 2-FSK or 2-CPFSK modulations is to send waveforms at different frequencies based on the input bit sequence. Usually, the bit sequence is first converted into a symbol sequence $\mathbf{I}$. In a binary case, the symbol mapping can be the following: a symbol $I=1$ is sent when the bit to send is a $1$ whereas the symbol $I=-1$ is associated to the bit $0$. In this case, the two reference waveforms in baseband are:
\begin{equation*}
    e_I(t)\:=\:\exp{\left(j 2\pi I \Delta_f t \right)}\:=\:\begin{cases}
    e_{s_1}(t)\:=\:\exp{\left(j 2\pi \Delta_f t \right)}\:\:\:\text{if}\:\: I=1,\\
    e_{s_0}(t)\:=\:\exp{\left(-j 2\pi \Delta_f t \right)}\:\:\:\text{if}\:\: I=-1,
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
with $\Delta_f$ the frequency deviation (in hertz). This is only what is sent over one symbol period $T$. Following the lecture developments, the baseband representation of a whole 2-CPFSK signal is given by
\begin{equation*}
    x(t)\:=\:e^{j\phi(t)} \qquad \text{with} \qquad \phi(t)\:=\:\:2\pi \Delta_f \int_{-\infty}^t \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}I[k]\:g(\tau-kT) \text{d}\tau,
\end{equation*}
where $\phi(t)$ is the phase, $T$ is the symbol period (in second) and $I[k]$ is the k-th sent symbol. Moreover, $g(t)$ is a rectangular pulse shaping filter defined only on a symbol period, i.e.,
\begin{equation*}
    g(t)\:=\:\begin{cases} 1 \qquad \text{for} \: 0 \leq t \leq T\\
    0 \qquad \text{otherwise.}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
The use of $g(t)$ shifted by some symbol periods in the summation enables to represent continuously the symbol sequence, whereas the integration over $\tau$ ensures continuous phase.

\paragraph{Packet structure} In practice, for the LELEC2102-3 project, the bit sequence is not sent continuously. Instead, they are grouped in several packets, each of them having the structure presented in \autoref{tab:packet_struc}. This packet structure comes from the specifications of the radio (RF transceiver) used in the project (S2-LP device from STMicroelectronics, see \href{https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/s2-lp.pdf}{\textcolor{blue}{[S2-LP datasheet]}}).
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\caption{Packet structure.}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\rowcolor[HTML]{C0C0C0}
Preamble   & Sync word  & Payload       &  CRC             \\ \hline
4 bytes    & 4 bytes    & 0:65535 bytes & 1 byte           \\
\py{0xAAAAAAAA} & \py{0x3E2A54B7} & ...           & Based on payload \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:packet_struc}
\end{table}
The different parts of the packets are motivated by their respective roles:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The preamble is a repeating sequence that enables to easily identify the beginning of a packet. Usually, the repeating bit sequence is made of "$01$" or "$10$".
\item The sync word is a chosen sequence that is known by the receiver. It is useful for synchronization purposes and can be chosen. In the basic version of the project, it is arbitrarily set to \py{0x3E2A54B7}.
    \item The payload contains the message bits. Its length can vary but will be fixed to a given value to ensure packets of same length.
    \item CRC (cyclic redundancy check): is used in practice to detect transmission error and drop packets containing errors. It is not implemented in the simulation framework but it will be used in the practical chain (see next hands-on).
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Channel model}
For this project, we neglect multipath propagation such that the channel is considered to be flat fading. In this case, using the channel equivalent baseband representation, the received signal $y(t)$ is modeled by
\begin{equation*}
    y(t) = a\: e^{j\phi_0}\: e^{j2\pi \Delta f_c t} \:x(t-\tau) + w(t),
\end{equation*}
where $a$ is the attenuation, $\phi_0$ is the phase shift and $\Delta f_c$ is the carrier frequency offset. Furthermore, $\tau$ depicts the delay, such that $\tau=kT+\tau_d$ with $k$ an integer and $\tau_d$ a delay between 0 and $T$. Finally, $w(t)$ is an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN).



\subsection{Reception chain}
Based on the channel model and the packet structure, the reception chain of \autoref{fig:comm_chain} has been defined by the teaching team. At the input of the receiver, one has access to the complex baseband signal $y(t)$ sampled at a given sampling frequency whereas, at the output of the reception chain, the payload bits are recovered.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/comm_chain.pdf}
    \caption{Reception chain.}
    \label{fig:comm_chain}
\end{figure}

Currently, we will focus on this chain in simulation but starting from next hands-on, the blocks highlighted in orange in \autoref{fig:comm_chain} will be implemented in GnuRadio whereas the red blocks will execute in hardware. This chain contains the following blocks:

\paragraph{Low-pass filter}
This filter limits the noise bandwidth at the input of the reception chain.

\paragraph{Preamble detection}
The goal of the preamble detection is to determine the start of packets: when it detects a packet (based on its preamble energy for example), this packet is forwarded to the next steps of the chain and is demodulated. When no packets are detected, nothing is demodulated and computational resource is spared.

\paragraph{Synchronization}
This block is responsible for the CFO (carrier frequency offset) and STO (symbol timing offset) synchronizations. In other words, it estimates and corrects the frequency offset $\Delta f_c$ as well as the fractional delay $\tau_d$. However, no phase estimation ($\phi_0$) is performed.


\paragraph{Demodulation}
The demodulator recovers the symbol sequence based on the CPFSK modulated signal and converts these symbols back to bits. Its output is therefore a bit sequence, containing the preamble, sync word, payload and CRC bits. Since the phase shift $\phi_0$ has not been corrected, non-coherent demodulation is used.

\paragraph{Packet parser}
Finally, the packet parser is responsible for determining the beginning of the payload bits in the bit sequence coming from the demodulator. As such, it recovers the frame delay $kT$. The CRC is also checked to determine if all bits have been demodulated properly.

\subsection{Simulation framework}
The provided simulation framework contains four files:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{sim.py}: this is the body of the simulation framework. It modulates the sent packets, applies the channel and uses the synchronization and demodulation functions implemented by \texttt{Chain} subclasses. It provides several performance metrics as outputs. Normally, you should not modify anything in this file, except the plots at the end if you want to customize them and the simulated chain at the very bottom. You can also add an automatic save of the simulation data to post-process it later on. Nevertheless, you are highly encouraged to skim through the file and the comments to understand the different steps involved.
    \item \textbf{chain.py}: this contains the \texttt{Chain} with most of the modulation parameters and the prototypes of the modulation, demodulation and synchronization functions. You can change the modulation parameters in this file if you want to study their effects but you will implement the functions in subclasses, e.g., \texttt{BasicChain}.
    \item \textbf{test.py}: the purpose of this file is to help you to implement the demodulation and CFO estimation functions. Indeed, it contains a simplified version of the communication chain, useful for debugging your implementation.
\end{itemize}

In order to launch the simulation, you only have to execute the \textbf{sim.py} file as it includes and calls the two other files. Try to run the simulation. You should observe a bit error rate (BER) of 0.5 since the demodulation is not implemented.

In the next sections, we will investigate step by step the different blocks of the simulation framework.

\section{FSK modulation and demodulation}
We first consider the modulation and demodulation, leaving aside any synchronization issue.

\subsection{Modulation}
The simulation framework models the baseband signal $x(t)$ sampled at a given symbol period $T$. Moreover, an oversampling factor $R_{\text{TX}}$ is applied, meaning that samples of $x(t) $ are available every $T/R_{\text{TX}}$. In other words, $R_{\text{TX}}$ samples are available during the symbol period $T$ of one CPFSK symbol. Hence, the sampled baseband signal is defined by

\begin{equation*}
    x[m] \:=\:x\left(m\frac{T}{R_{\text{TX}}}\right)\:=\:\exp \left(j\pi \frac{h}{T} \int_{-\infty}^{\frac{mT}{R_{\text{TX}}}} \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}I[k]\:g(\tau-kT) \text{d}\tau \right),
\end{equation*}
where $h=2 \Delta_f T$ is the modulation index.
Assuming a symbol mapping such as the bit $0$ (resp. bit $1$) corresponds to the symbol $-1$ (resp. symbol $1$), the associated Python code to generate $x[m]$ from an input bit sequence is given in \autoref{fig:code_mod}. It is not a direct application of the mathematics presented above but instead an iterative generation of the CPFSK waveform. Indeed, in the for loop, the phase continuity is ensured simply by storing in memory the ending phase of the previous symbol. The phase shift during one symbol is given by $\pm h\pi$.

\begin{listing}[H]
\inputpython{modulate.py}
\caption{Python code for 2-CPFSK modulation.}
\label{fig:code_mod}
\end{listing}



As an example, the 2-CPFSK signal of the bit sequence "$0010110$" modulated with a bit rate $B$ of \SI{50}{\kilo\hertz}, a frequency deviation $\Delta_f=\frac{B}{4}$ and a TX oversampling factor $R_{\text{TX}}=4$ is given in \autoref{fig:2CPFSKbaseband}\footnote{You can generate figures similar to this one using the file \textbf{test.py}.}. You can also observe the continuous analog waveform $x(t)$ in light blue. Make sure you understand the different representations given in the figure (complex baseband representations). Determine the symbol period and, looking at the evolution of the phase, try to recover the sent bits.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figures/2-cpfsk-bis.pdf}
    \caption{Example of 2-CPFSK baseband signal of the bit sequence "$0010110$".}
    \label{fig:2CPFSKbaseband}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Demodulation}
Assuming perfect synchronization and no attenuation, the received signal is only impacted by the noise, such that
\begin{equation*}
    y(t)\:=\:x(t) + w(t).
\end{equation*}
Classically, for 2-FSK or 2-CPFSK modulations, one tends to demodulate the received signal by computing its correlations with the reference waveforms ($e_{s_1}(t)$ and $e_{s_0}(t)$ in baseband) \textbf{over each symbol period}:
\begin{equation*}
    r_1\:=\:\frac{1}{T}\int_0^T y(t)\:e_{s_1}^*(t) \:\text{d}t\qquad \text{and} \qquad r_0\:=\:\frac{1}{T}\int_0^T y(t)\:e_{s_0}^*(t) \:\text{d}t.
\end{equation*}

The \textbf{coherent detection} then compares the \textbf{real part} of $r_1$ and $r_0$ to select the largest as the most likely sent symbol. However, this assumes that the phase of the received signal is known, which is not the case here (as this would imply to add another synchronization block dedicated to the phase estimation).

In the case of \textbf{non-coherent detection}, the \textbf{modulus} of $r_1$ and $r_0$ is compared and the decision is taken as follows:
\begin{align*}
    &\hat{I}[k]=1 \: \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\text{if}\:\:\: |r_1| > |r_0|,\\
    &\hat{I}[k]=-1 \:\: \:\:\text{if}\:\:\: |r_1| < |r_0|.
\end{align*}

The decision is therefore taken symbol by symbol, considering the waveform $y(t)$ only during the symbol period $T$ of the symbol $I[k]$.

In practice, one does not have access to $y(t)$ but instead to $y[n]$, i.e., a sampled version with a symbol period $T$ and an oversampling factor $R_{\text{RX}}$ used at the receiver:
\begin{equation*}
    y[n]\:=\:y\left(\frac{nT}{R_{\text{RX}}}\right)\:=\:x\left(\frac{nT}{R_{\text{RX}}}\right)+w\left(\frac{nT}{R_{\text{RX}}}\right)\:=\: x[n] + w[n].
\end{equation*}
Therefore, the decision variables $r_1$ and $r_0$ for the symbol $I[k]$ are approximated by:
\begin{small}
\begin{equation*}
    r_1\:\approx\:\frac{1}{R_{\text{RX}}}\sum_{n=0}^{R_{\text{RX}}-1} y[kR_{\text{RX}}+n] \:\exp \left(-j2\pi \Delta_f \frac{nT}{R_{\text{RX}}}\right)\qquad \text{and} \qquad r_0\:\approx\:\frac{1}{R_{\text{RX}}}\sum_{n=0}^{R_{\text{RX}}-1} y[kR_{\text{RX}}+n] \:\exp \left(j2\pi \Delta_f \frac{nT}{R_{RX}}\right).
\end{equation*}
\end{small}

\begin{bclogo}[couleur = gray!20, arrondi = 0.2, logo=\bccrayon]{Implementation of demodulation}
Complete the \py{demodulate()} function in the file \textbf{chain.py} based on the development presented above (non-coherent detection) and the comments. Test your implementation using \textbf{test.py} and make sure the demodulated bits are the same as the sent ones (since there is no added noise).
\end{bclogo}

\subsection{BER-SNR curve}
Due to the noise on the received signal, the demodulation may suffer from errors. In the simulation, the noise is added on each sample by taking an independent realisation of a complex normal random variable with zero-mean $\mathcal{CN}(0,\sigma_w^2)$. The noise power in discrete time is given by the variance $\sigma_w^2$ of the complex normal random variable and can be linked to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), knowing that the sent waveforms are normalized (i.e., power of 1):
\begin{equation*}
    \text{SNR}\:=\:\frac{1}{\sigma_w^2}.
\end{equation*}

This SNR is therefore defined on each sample, meaning that a SNR of 0 dB implies that the instantaneous power of the signal is equal to the average power of the noise. This SNR is known in the simulation framework but in practice you may have to estimate it, see appendix \ref{appA}.




\paragraph{Bit error rate}
Often, the demodulation performances of a communication chain are determined by measuring the bit error rate (BER). It is defined as the probability of making a demodulation error on a bit. To compute it in simulation, many iterations are performed with thousands of bits sent and the error probability is simply obtained by counting the number of bits demodulated properly and the ones suffering from a demodulation error. Thus the simulation framework can directly output a simulated BER-SNR curve, for the range of SNRs specified in \textbf{chain.py}.

This simulated BER-SNR curve can then be compared to some theoretical curves, obtained thanks to mathematical developments based on the decision variable and the model of the noise (AWGN). For example, the bit error probability in the case of a BPSK transmission is given by
\begin{equation*}
    p_{e,\text{BPSK}}\:=\:\frac{1}{2} \text{erfc}\left(\sqrt{\text{SNR}_o}\right),
\end{equation*}
where $\text{SNR}_o$ is the SNR on the decision variable.

In the case of a FSK transmission with orthogonal signals, the bit error probability is
\begin{equation*}
    p_{e,\text{FSK}}\:=\:\frac{1}{2} \text{erfc}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\text{SNR}_o}{2}}\right).
\end{equation*}

Finally, when non-coherent (nc) detection is used with (CP)FSK orthogonal signals:
\begin{equation*}
    p_{e,\text{FSK nc}}\:=\:\frac{1}{2}e^{-\text{SNR}_o/2}.
\end{equation*}

The expressions of these theoretical curves enable you to compare your simulation results with the theory. However, the theoretical expressions involve the SNR on the decision variable, denoted $\text{SNR}_o$, and not directly the SNR defined previously, on each sample. The link between these two quantities is extracted from the definition of the decision variable. For example, the decision variable $r_1$ when the sent symbol $I[k]$ is a $1$ is (looking only over one symbol, assuming $k=0$ for simplicity):
\begin{small}
\begin{align*}
    r_1\: &= \:\frac{1}{R_{\text{RX}}}\sum_{n=0}^{R_{\text{RX}}-1} y[n] \:\exp \left(-j2\pi \Delta_f \frac{nT}{R_{\text{RX}}}\right)\\
    &=\:\frac{1}{R_{\text{RX}}}\sum_{n=0}^{R_{\text{RX}}-1} \left(\exp \left(j2\pi \Delta_f \frac{nT}{R_{\text{RX}}}\right)+w[n]\right) \:\exp \left(-j2\pi \Delta_f  \frac{nT}{R_{\text{RX}}}\right)\\
    &=\:1\:+\:\frac{1}{R_{\text{RX}}}\sum_{n=0}^{R_{\text{RX}}-1} \underbrace{w[n] \:\exp \left(-j2\pi \Delta_f \frac{nT}{R_{\text{RX}}}\right)}_{w'[n] \:\sim\: \mathcal{CN}(0,\sigma_w^2)}\:=\:1\:+\:\underbrace{\frac{1}{R_{\text{RX}}}\sum_{n=0}^{R_{\text{RX}}-1} w'[n]}_{\tilde{w}},
\end{align*}
\end{small}
because the exponential is just introducing a phase shift of the noise and thus does not change its variance. Since the $w'[n]$ are independent and identically distributed, the variable $\sum_{n=0}^{R_{\text{RX}}-1} w'[n]$ follows a distribution $\mathcal{CN}(0,R_{\text{RX}}\sigma_w^2)$ and $\tilde{w}\:\sim\:\mathcal{CN}(0,\frac{\sigma_w^2}{R_{\text{RX}}})$. The $\text{SNR}_o$ on the decision variable $r_1$ is therefore given by the ratio between the power of the useful signal ($=1$) and the power of the noise ($=\sigma_w^2/R_{\text{RX}}$):
\begin{equation*}
    \text{SNR}_{o}\:=\:\frac{R_{\text{RX}}}{\sigma_w^2}\:=\:R_{\text{RX}}\: \text{SNR}.
\end{equation*}
\textbf{This expression is only valid if the noise is white. If it has been filtered (i.e. the noise samples are correlated), it must be adapted.} Nevertheless,
this explains the SNR shift (in dB) that you can find in the simulation framework. Intuitively, it comes from the fact that $R_{\text{RX}}$ samples are aggregated together in the decision variable and add up coherently, whereas the $R_{\text{RX}}$ noise samples does not add coherently.

\begin{bclogo}[couleur = gray!20, arrondi = 0.2, logo=\bccrayon]{Simulation of BER-SNR curve}
You now have all the necessary explanations to understand the generation of BER-SNR curves by the simulation framework and compare them with the theory. In \textbf{chain.py}, make sure all the booleans bypassing the synchronization are set to \py{True}. Then, run the file and observe the generated BER-SNR curves. Do they stick to the theoretical curves?

Normally, your curve should have a trend similar to the theoretical curve, hinting that your demodulate function works properly. However, you can expect some differences but do not investigate them now. This will be part of the characterization report as well as of future improvements in the communication part of the project.

If needed, you can change the range of SNRs as well as the number of packets and the number of bits per packet in \textbf{chain.py}.
\end{bclogo}
\paragraph{Packet error rate (PER)} A packet is said to be erroneous if at least one bit of the packet is not demodulated properly. Following this definition, the probability of packet error $P_e$ is related to the bit error rate $p_e$ by
\begin{equation*}
    P_e\:=\:1- (1-p_e)^{N_b},
\end{equation*}
where $N_b$ is the number of bits in a packet and $(1-p_e)^{N_b}$ is the probability that all the bits of the packet are demodulated properly.
\begin{bclogo}[couleur = gray!20, arrondi = 0.2, logo=\bccrayon]{Simulation of PER-SNR curve}
In simulation, to obtain a meaningful PER curve, do not forget to increase the number of sent packets in \textbf{chain.py}.
\end{bclogo}



\section{Synchronization}
It is now time to tackle some synchronization issues, following the channel model and the reception chain presented in the first section. Most of it has already been implemented for you, based on the explanations given below.

\subsection{Preamble detection}
The preamble is made of a repeating sequence of bits "$10$". It enables to identify the start of a packet at the receiver, which is particularly useful for the practical chain. In order to study its performance in simulation, an extra sequence of pure noise is added in front of the packets to simulate the reception of noise when no packets are sent.

\paragraph{Energy detection} The algorithm chosen for the preamble detection is based on the received signal energy. The main idea is simply to take the modulus of the received samples and check that it is above a given threshold. In simulation, this threshold should be close to 1 since the received useful signal has an energy of 1. However, in practice, the received signal energy depends on the TX and RX gain, as well as the transmission distance. Therefore the threshold should be reduced to allow more flexibility in the communication range.

This energy detection can be performed sample by sample or using an averaging window of size $L$, as given in \autoref{fig:code_preb}. A preamble is detected if $\sum_{n=0}^{L-1}|y[n]| \: > \: \lambda$,
with $\lambda$ the energy threshold, and its position is then returned by the function.

\begin{listing}[H]
\begin{python}
from typing import Optional

import numpy as np

def preamble_detect(self, y: np.array) -> Optional[int]:
    """
    Detects the preamlbe in a given received signal.

    :param y: The received signal, (n * R,).
    :return: The index where the preamble starts,
        or None if not found.
    """
    L = 4*self.osr_rx
    y_abs = np.abs(y)

    for i in range(0, int(len(y)/L)):
        sum_abs = np.sum(y_abs[i*L:(i+1)*L])
        if sum_abs > (L-1): #fix threshold
            return i*L

    return None

\end{python}
\caption{Python code for preamble detection (from \textbf{chain.py}).}
\label{fig:code_preb}
\end{listing}

\paragraph{Metrics} The performance of the preamble detection algorithm can be evaluated with two metrics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The percentage of false detection. A false detection occurs when the preamble detector triggers in the noise, when there is no packet to be found.
    \item The percentage of miss detection. A miss detection occurs when a preamble is not found or found too late (in the packet payload).
\end{itemize}

\begin{bclogo}[couleur = gray!20, arrondi = 0.2, logo=\bccrayon]{Simulation of preamble detection}
Set the bypassing boolean of the preamble detection to \py{False} in \textbf{chain.py}. Launch the simulation and observe the preamble detection metrics automatically displayed.
\end{bclogo}

\subsection{Frequency offset estimation}
The carrier frequency offset $\Delta f_c$ comes from a mismatch between the carrier frequency $f_c$ at the transmitter and the carrier frequency $f'_c$ used at the receiver: $\Delta f_c=f_c-f'_c$. This offset can also change over time due to temperature variations in the reference clocks generating the carrier frequencies at TX and RX. For the project, it has been decided to estimate the frequency offset for each received packet, assuming it is not varying during one packet duration (hypothesis verified in practice).

\paragraph{Moose algorithm} Based on repetition properties of a training sequence, the Moose algorithm can estimate the frequency offset from this sequence. Here, we use the repetition of "$10$" in the preamble, since the start of the preamble has already been roughly identified by the preamble detection block.

Disregarding other synchronization parameters except a frequency offset $\Delta f_c$, a received sequence containing a repetition of a block of size $N_t=N\cdot R_{\text{RX}}$ (with $N$ the number of CPFSK symbols) has the following property:

\begin{align*}
    y[n+N_t] \:&=\:e^{j2\pi \Delta f_c \frac{(n+N_t)T}{R_{\text{RX}}}} \:x\left(\frac{(n+N_t)T}{R_{\text{RX}}}\right) \:+\: w[n+N_t]\\
    &=\:e^{j2\pi \Delta f_c \frac{N_tT}{R_{\text{RX}}}} \underbrace{e^{j2\pi \Delta f_c \frac{nT}{R_{\text{RX}}}}\:x\left(\frac{nT}{R_{\text{RX}}}\right)}_{\approx y[n]} \:+\: w[n+N_t]\\
    &\approx \:e^{j2\pi \Delta f_c \frac{N_tT}{R_{\text{RX}}}}\: y[n].
\end{align*}
with the approximation coming from the noise realisations that are different on $y[n]$ and $y[n+N_t]$.

In order to estimate $\Delta f_c$ using this property, a modified least square problem can be formulated:
\begin{equation*}
    \hat{\alpha} = a \:e^{j2\pi \widehat{\Delta f_c} \frac{N_tT}{R_{\text{RX}}}} = \arg\min_{\alpha} \: \sum_{l=0}^{N_t-1} \left|y[l+N_t] - \alpha y[l]\right|^2.
\end{equation*}
The solution of this problem is given by
\begin{equation*}
    \hat{\alpha} =  \frac{\sum_{l=0}^{N_t-1} y[l+N_t]y^*[l]}{\sum_{l=0}^{N_t-1} |y[l]|^2},
\end{equation*}
and therefore the estimate of the frequency offset is obtained:
\begin{equation*}
     \widehat{\Delta f_c} = \frac{\arg\left\{\hat{\alpha}\right\}}{2 \pi \frac{N_tT}{R_{\text{RX}}}} = \frac{\arg\left\{\sum_{l=0}^{N_t-1} y[l+N_t]y^*[l]\right\}}{2 \pi \frac{N_tT}{R_{\text{RX}}}}.
\end{equation*}

Owing to the periodicity of the complex exponential, the Moose algorithm can estimate frequency offsets in the range $-\pi$ to $\pi$ for its argument, meaning that the range for $\widehat{\Delta f_c}$ is:
\begin{equation*}
    |\widehat{\Delta f_c}| \leq \frac{R_{\text{RX}}}{2N_tT}\:=\:\frac{B}{2N}.
\end{equation*}
In order to improve the estimation, a larger $N_t$ is preferable to increase noise averaging, but it reduces the range of non ambiguous frequency offset estimations. A solution to this issue can be based on multiple repetitions of short training sequences in the preamble.

\paragraph{Metric and correction}
The metric to monitor the accuracy of the frequency offset estimation is the root mean square error (RMSE), defined as
\begin{equation*}
    \text{RMSE}_{\Delta f_c}\:=\:T\sqrt{\left\langle\left(\widehat{\Delta f_c}-\Delta f_c\right)^2\right\rangle},
\end{equation*}
with $\left\langle ... \right\rangle$ denoting the mean over all iterations in the simulation, $\widehat{\Delta f_c}$ the estimated frequency offset and $\Delta f_c$ the real offset.

From the estimation of the frequency offset, the frequency offset correction is simply performed as follows:
\begin{equation*}
    \tilde{y}[n] = e^{-j2\pi \widehat{\Delta f_c} \frac{nT}{R_{\text{RX}}}}\:y[n].
\end{equation*}


\begin{bclogo}[couleur = gray!20, arrondi = 0.2, logo=\bccrayon]{Implementation of Moose algorithm}
Implement the Moose algorithm in the \py{cfo_estimation()} function in \textbf{chain.py}. The preamble has already been detected, such that the first samples of the input vector $y$ contains repeating sequence of modulated "$10$". Use blocks of 4 bits ($N=4$) and return $\widehat{\Delta f_c}$.

To test your implementation, first use \textbf{test.py} and make sure the estimated CFO corresponds to the applied one. You can then use the \textbf{chain.py} file, setting the CFO bypass boolean to \py{False}. Look at the RMSE, does it decrease with larger SNR?

By default, the CFOs applied in the simulation are random, in the range specified in \textbf{chain.py}. You can also decide to apply a constant frequency offset by giving a non-zero value to \py{cfo_val} in \textbf{chain.py} and removing \py{cfo_val = np.nan} in \textbf{chain.py}.
\end{bclogo}



\subsection{Symbol timing}
The symbol timing correction is performed after the correction of the frequency offset meaning that, ideally, the only remaining impairment (other than the timing error) is the noise. As already mentioned previously, the delay $\tau$ can be split in a delay multiple of the symbol period ($kT$ with $k$ an integer) and a fractional delay $\tau_d$ between 0 and $T$. The goal of the symbol timing block here is to correct the delay $\tau_d$ while the delay $kT$ is handled later by the frame estimation in the packet parser.

Since the received signal is oversampled by the factor $R_{\text{RX}}$, estimating $\tau_d$ resumes to choosing which sample (among $R_{\text{RX}}$ samples) defines the start of new CPFSK symbols. To do so, the multiple of $\frac{T}{R_{\text{RX}}}$
closest to $\tau_d$ is selected. This is illustrated in \autoref{fig:timing_ex} where $R_{\text{RX}}=4$ and the estimated symbol timing $\hat{\tau}_d$ is given by $\frac{dT}{R_{\text{RX}}}$.

    \label{fig:timing_ex}
\end{figure}

It is possible to estimate the symbol timing by determining the instants where one observes a change in the derivative of the phase. This corresponds to a change in the sent waveform, that can happen only every multiple of the oversampling factor $R_{\text{RX}}$. As an example, \autoref{fig:phase_funct} gives the phase function and its derivatives corresponding to the sent bit sequence "$0010110$" with an oversampling factor $R_{\text{RX}}=32$. As expected, we identify peaks in the second derivative of the phase corresponding to the transition between symbols $1$ and $-1$ (and vice-versa).

With a delay $\tau_d$, all these peaks are not located in multiple of the symbol period but instead in $\tau_d+m T$ with $m\in \mathbb{Z}$. Then $\tau_d$ can be estimated using the function \py{sto_estimation()} in \textbf{chain.py}, as given in \autoref{fig:code_symb}.

\subsection{Frame estimation}
Finally, only the frame estimation remains and is implemented in the packet parser. At this stage, bits have been demodulated and one is interested in knowing where the payload bits start.

Since the sent packets contain a sequence known by the receiver (the sync word sequence), the receiver can locate this sequence in the demodulated bits. Then the bits after this sequence will be the payload bits. This is achieved by performing a correlation between the demodulated bit sequence and the known sequence (\py{sync_word}, encoded in \textbf{chain.py}). This correlation is computed in \textbf{sim.py} by first converting the bit sequences into symbol sequences of $-1$ and $1$. The Python code is given in \autoref{fig:code_fr}.
\begin{listing}[H]
\begin{python}
import numpy as np

v = np.abs(np.correlate(bits_hat*2-1, np.array(chain.sync_word)*2-1, mode="full"))
start_frame = np.argmax(v)+1
bits_hat_pay = bits_hat[start_frame:start_frame+chain.payload_len]

\end{python}
\caption{Python code for frame estimation (from \textbf{sim.py}).}
\label{fig:code_fr}
\end{listing}

\paragraph{Metric} The accuracy of the total delay estimation can be evaluated with the RMSE:
\begin{equation*}
    \text{RMSE}_{\tau}\:=\:\frac{1}{T}\sqrt{\left\langle\left(\hat{\tau}-\tau\right)^2\right\rangle}\:=\:\frac{1}{T}\sqrt{\left\langle\left(\hat{d}\frac{T}{R_{\text{RX}}}+\hat{k}T-\tau\right)^2\right\rangle},
\end{equation*}
where $\hat{d}$ comes from the symbol timing estimation and $\hat{k}$ comes from the frame estimation.



\begin{bclogo}[couleur = gray!20, arrondi = 0.2, logo=\bccrayon]{Simulation of frame and symbol timing estimations}
Set the bypassing boolean of the symbol timing estimation to \py{False} in \textbf{chain.py}. Launch the simulation and observe the symbol timing RMSE automatically displayed. Does it decrease with increasing SNRs?

By default, the delays applied in the simulation are random, in the range specified by \py{sto_range} in \textbf{chain.py}. You can also decide to apply a constant timing offset by giving a non-zero value to \py{sto_val} in \textbf{chain.py} and removing \py{sto_val = np.nan} in \textbf{chain.py}.
