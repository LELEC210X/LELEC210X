\section*{Introduction}

In this Hands-On, you will work on the commmunication between the sensor node
and the receiver. You already analyzed the lower layers (physical and data
link) in H4, and we will now focus on the higher layers. That is, we now
consider the part of the processing chain that maps the feature vectors into a
\emph{packet}, which is the transmitted as the payload of the communication
chain of H4.

In this hands-on, we will not use the radio as the lower layer and will instead
rely on the UART communication between the MCU and the PC, as it is more
reliable and simpler to run.
