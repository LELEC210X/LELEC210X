\section*{Introduction}

In this Hands-On, you will be introduced to the basics of microcontroller unit (MCU) operation and interrupt-based embedded programming. We will use so-called bare metal programming, which means we will not use an operating system: you will be in control of all the code that runs on the device! As this is most likely your first project dealing with bare metal embedded programming, we will provide you with a functional baseline code to start with. Then, you will be guided step by step to develop the key skills needed for this part of the project.

In this note, there are a few boxes presenting additional information:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \bcinfo will provide you some more detailed explanations.
    \item \bcattention will explain typical mistakes that might lead to errors or a non functional system.
    \item \bcquestion will provide you with additional questions or experiments that will improve your understanding of the system. We advise you to leave them for the end of the hands-on as they are not critical.
\end{itemize}
