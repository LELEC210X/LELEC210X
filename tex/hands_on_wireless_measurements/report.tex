\section{Report and demonstration}

\subsection{Demonstration}

On the next session, we expect from each group a quick demonstration showing a correct reception of 5 packets transmitted over the air using the radio evaluation mode
at the default Tx power level of \SI{-16}{\decibel\meter}. The noise power should be estimated and set in the application such that the SNR estimation is correct.

\subsection{Report}

Please upload a report that contains contents for the two wireless communications sessions.
The guidelines for the previous session are to be found in the corresponding hands-on.

For \textbf{this session}, we expect a \textbf{maximum} 2 pages with
\begin{itemize}
    \item Screenshot of the GNU Radio Companion console showing the correct CFO estimation and demodulation of \textbf{one} packet from the capture we provided you.
    \item Using over the air transmissions with a \SI{60}{\decibel} Rx gain and the LPF enabled, evaluate the minimum SNR required to correctly receive packets.
    Does this SNR value correspond to the simulation results you observed in the simulation? Discuss.
\end{itemize}
