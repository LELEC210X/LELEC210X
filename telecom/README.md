# Telecom Simulation

Three files are provided for the simulation:

- `chain.py`, defining the base class for a telecom chain: your implementation should subclass `Chain` or directly modify `BasicChain` and implement the missing blocks.
- `test_chain.py`, testing the chain implementation (executated with `uv run pytest`).
- `simulate.py`, running the actual simulations (executed with `uv run simulate`).

# SDR

TODO.
