# Telecom Simulation

Only the `sim.py` and `test.py` files should be executed.

When doing so, make sure to run them with Rye, e.g., do:

```bash
rye run python sim.py
```

to run the simulation or:

```bash
rye run pytest test.py
```

to the your chain implementation.

Finally, the `chain.py` file contains two classes: `Chain` and `BasicChain`.
You should only change the latter, by filling the missing code lines.
