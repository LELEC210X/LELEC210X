def timeit(fun: Callable[..., Any]) -> Callable[..., Any]:
    """
    Wrapper around a function and registers timing statistics about it.

    When the program exits (e.g., with CTRL + C), this utility
    will print short message with mean execution duration.

    Usage:

        Say you have a function definition:

        >>> def my_function(a, b):
        ...     pass

        You can simply use this utility as follows:

        >>> from .utils import timeit
        >>>
        >>> @timeit
        ... def my_function(a, b):
        ...     pass

    Note that you can use this decorator as many times as you want.
